## About
Lutherian DB stores data as name-value pairs. This feature allows users to retrieve and update data quickly and efficiently. Additionally, Lutherian DB is designed for high performance, security, and ease of use.

One of the key features of Lutherian DB is the use of an AI-powered cache management system called Consul. Consul helps ensure high data accuracy by determining which data should be removed from the cache based on usage patterns. This maintains high performance while reducing the risk of data inconsistencies.

Another important feature of Lutherian DB is its layered data processing system called Optima, which provides high performance and flexibility in data processing. Optima provides scalability in data processing.

Another feature is that Lutherian DB can support different data storage methods. Besides name-value pairs, users can store data with different data structures with kernels to be added later, for example: spider web. This flexibility allows users to choose the data storage method that best suits their needs.

Finally, Lutherian DB includes the ability to add data manipulation layers to the database. This allows users to perform complex data transformations and analyzes directly within the database without the need to extract and process data in separate systems.

Overall, Lutherian DB is a flexible, performant and secure database system designed to meet the needs of a wide range of users. Its AI-powered cache management, support for different data storage methods, Optima layered data processing system and its ability to perform complex data processing make it an ideal choice for organizations that require fast and efficient data management.
